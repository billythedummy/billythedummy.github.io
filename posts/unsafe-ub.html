          >TigerBeetle's design of no runtime memory allocations</a
        >, I decided to build a zero runtime memory allocation data structure in
        rust. It seemed like a least-recently-used (LRU) cache was a natural fit
        for such a requirement, since they typically involve a fixed capacity,
        beyond which the least-recently-used element was evicted to make room
        for a new one. Furthermore, I had some needs for one in another project,
        so all the stars were aligned to make
        <a href="https://docs.rs/const-lru/latest/const_lru/"
          ><code>const-lru</code></a
        >
        happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        What the stars were not aligned on, however, was the amount of undefined
        behaviour (UB) I would inadvertently introduce in the initial
        development of <code>const-lru</code>.
      </p>
      <h4>Uninitialized memory is a UB minefield</h4>
      <p>
        Since the capacity of the LRU cache was designed to be fixed at
        compile-time, I decided to store the required data in a couple of
        const-generic array fields. In other words, something like:
      </p>
      <pre class="language-rust"><code>
pub struct ConstLru&lt;K, V, const CAP: usize&gt; {
    keys: [K; CAP],
    values: [V; CAP],
    ... // other fields
}
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        This was all fine and dandy for small values of <code>CAP</code>, but at
        larger values, this was causing runtime stack overflows.
        <code>Box::new(ConstLru::new())</code> did not help either because
        semantically this meant "create a new <code>ConstLru</code> on the stack
        and then move that <code>ConstLru</code> into a newly allocated region
        in the heap", so the stack overflow still occurred in the first step.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since I wanted to keep the crate
        <code>no-std</code> and not dependent on <code>alloc</code>, I decided
        to create a new <code>unsafe</code> function,
        <code>init_at_alloc(ptr: *mut Self)</code>, to allow users to create
        large <code>CAP</code> <code>ConstLru</code>s at pre-allocated memory.
        This allows for stuff like:
      </p>
      <pre class="language-rust"><code>
let layout = Layout::new::&lt;ConstLru&lt;u32, u16, 10_000, u16&gt;&gt;();
let container: Box&lt;ConstLru&lt;u32, u16, 10_000, u16&gt;&gt; = unsafe {
    let ptr = alloc(layout) as *mut ConstLru&lt;u32, u16, 10_000, u16&gt;;
    ConstLru::init_at_alloc(ptr);
    Box::from_raw(ptr)
};
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        I could then run a common init procedure for both stack and pointer
        initializations in order to set the correct starting state for the
        struct's fields. Surely a private <code>fn init(&mut self)</code>, where
        the pointer initialization is:
      </p>
      <pre class="language-rust"><code>
pub unsafe fn init_at_alloc(ptr: *mut Self) {
    let mut_ref = &mut *ptr;
    mut_ref.init();
}
      </code></pre>
      <p>and the stack initialization is:</p>
      <pre class="language-rust"><code>
pub fn new() -> Self {
    let mut res: MaybeUninit&lt;Self&gt; = MaybeUninit::uninit();
    unsafe {
        Self::init_at_alloc(res.as_mut_ptr());
        res.assume_init()
    }
}
      </code></pre>
      <p>would work, right?</p>
      <h4>Pointers may not always become references</h4>

        WRONG! After digging a little deeper into the

      <p>
        Oh no. Naturally, I had to change the function signature from
        <code>fn init(&mut self)</code> to <code>fn init(ptr: *mut Self)</code>,
        which meant <code>init_at_alloc(ptr: *mut Self)</code> became the common
        init procedure instead. It was kinda ugly changing all the
        <code>self.field = init_value</code> to
        <code>addr_of_mut!((*ptr).field).write(init_value)</code>, but it
        worked.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Always use <code>addr_of_mut!</code> to initialize uninitialized struct
        fields
      </h4>
      <p>
        The issue was resolved but the experience left me distraught. Rust, for
        all its virtues of stringent compile-time checking had failed to save me
        from myself. Besides, how many more instances of UB were left in my
        code? Surely there was a way to detect and fix them without going
        through the docs of every <code>unsafe</code> feature I was using.
      </p>
      <h4>Just use miri</h4>
      <p>
        Thankfully, there was. After some googling, I found out about
        <a
          href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >miri</a
        >, and it immediately proved to be a godsend. Here are some other
        instances of UB it caught:
      </p>
      <h4>
        Once you <code>assume_init()</code>, all fields MUST be initialized
      </h4>
      <p>
        In order to speed up the lookup process, <code>ConstLru</code> keeps a
        binary search index array as one of its fields, <code>bs_index</code>.
        Since the array consists of primitive unsigned integer values, I decided
        not to encapsulate the values in a <code>MaybeUninit</code>. As the
        program does not ever use any values in the array without initializing
        them, I thought it was fine to leave the field uninitialized when the
        <code>ConstLru</code> was created. After all, it was just a bunch of
        unused random integers. However, this is UB according to miri:
      </p>
      <pre class="language-rust"><code>
  error: Undefined Behavior: constructing invalid value at .value.bs_index[11]: encountered uninitialized bytes
  --> /home/user/const-lru/src/lib.rs:72:13
   |
72 |             res.assume_init()
   |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ constructing invalid value at .value.bs_index[11]: encountered uninitialized bytes
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        In hindsight, this is perfectly reasonable UB, since the compiler does
        not, and probably should not, treat primitive integers as a special case
        for allowing uninitialized fields; imagine what would happen if instead
        of a primitive integer, this was some other type with complex
        <code>Drop</code> behaviour like <code>Vec</code>. If this wasn't UB,
        the compiler will generate code that attempts to free memory at random
        addresses read from the uninitialized bytes!
      </p>
      <p>
        The fix for this UB was simple: just initialize the values. Though this
        does introduce some overhead at initialization.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <code>&array[i]</code> and <code>&mut array[i]</code> only borrows the
        single i-th element of the array
      </h4>
      <p>
        The above statement sounds obvious, so how can it result in UB? Well,
        what if you wanted to use <code>ptr::copy()</code> to shift an array by
        1 element, like in <code>Vec::remove()</code>?
      </p>
      <pre class="language-rust"><code>
// shift everything between [bs_i, len) right
let bs_i_ptr: *mut I = &mut self.bs_index[bs_i];
unsafe {
    ptr::copy(bs_i_ptr, bs_i_ptr.add(1), len - bs_i);
}
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        <code>bs_i_ptr</code> only mutably borrows
        <code>self.bs_index[bs_i]</code>. However, the
        <code>ptr::copy()</code> is attempting to mutate not
        <code>self.bs_index[bs_i]</code> but
        <code>self.bs_index[bs_i+1..len+1]</code> instead! miri catches this:
      </p>
      <pre class="language-rust"><code>

      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Admittedly, this is not immediately obvious since the multiple writes
        are somewhat obscured by the <code>ptr::copy()</code> call. I only
        understood the miri error message after chancing upon
        <a

      </p>
      <p>
        The "fix" for this UB wasn't really a fix. Since
        <code>ptr::copy()</code> is inherently an unsafe function, it makes
        sense to just express the procedure using fully unsafe types, i.e.
        pointers instead of references:
      </p>
      <pre class="language-rust"><code>
// shift everything between [bs_i, len) right
unsafe {
    let bs_i_ptr = self.bs_index.as_mut_ptr().add(bs_i);
    ptr::copy(bs_i_ptr, bs_i_ptr.add(1), len - bs_i);
}
      </code></pre>
      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        Rust is a safe language but unsafe rust is a totally different beast.
        Undefined behaviour abounds when you're dealing with raw pointers and
        uninitialized memory, but somebody has to do it to create the nice safe
        APIs. Luckily, miri makes avoiding unintentional UB a lot easier.
